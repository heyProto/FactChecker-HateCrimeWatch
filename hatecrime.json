Police said they â€œrescuedâ€ trader Alimuddin aka Asgar Ali from the attackers and he died in hospital. Ali of Monua village in Ramgarh district, nearly 50km from Ranchi, was allegedly carrying four sacks of meat weighing around 200kg. The mob intercepted him at Bazartand, pulled him out of the van, and thrashed him. Police arrived in 30 minutes and took him to Sadar hospital, Ramgarh, where he was referred to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi. Ali died minutes after he was admitted to the bigger hospital. Jharkhand police spokesperson RK Mallick said Thursdayâ€™s murder could be the result of a professional rivalry.",

When they saw the students marching, they got scared and again urged me to sort out the problem. Earlier, Rahman used to run a monetary fund, Basil, which was a part of the Rose Valley group. When Rose Valley was banned, he had to reimburse the deposited money of the customers by selling his small property and doing more tuition. The minorâ€™s grandfather was one of the depositors and he threatened Rahman with dire consequences for the delay in getting his deposited money. This may be the reason behind their framing of the false allegation.â€\n \n Superintendent of Police, Birbhum district said â€œThe charge sheet will be prepared once the investigation is completedâ€¦until then, we cannot comment on the issueâ€",

In a conversation with TwoCircles.net, Mubarak Quraishi (28) narrates a chilling story. “Arun Sahoo, the main accused in the Latehar incident and a member of the right wing extremist group, Bajrang Dal, has in the past held a pistol against my head and threatened to kill me. They asked me for a ransom of Rs 1 lakh and when I refused, I was taken to the nearby jungle where I was beaten to near death. Then, Sahoo and his associates had the tenacity to call the police and instruct them to ‘finish us off’,” says Mubarak. “The police did not kill me and took me to a hospital. I was admitted in Ranchi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for 15 days, but the police refused to even register an FIR in the matter,” he adds. The story of Hashim Quraishi is no different. A year ago, he and two of his friends were coming back to Balumath after purchasing cows for breeding and rearing. On their way, about 15-16 people stopped them in Bariatu and attacked them. “Shamim, the driver of the vehicle, was hit on his head with a blunt instrument. We were then taken captive and taken to the side of the road to be lynched.” Thankfully, Hashim said, a passerby alerted the police who arrived at the spot. “But even then, the police refused to arrest the perpetrators of such a crime. These are the same people who in March 2016 killed Mazloom Ansari and the minor Azaad Khan,” he adds.",

However, a senior BJP leader and minister in the central government called\n Akhlaqâ€™s killing an â€œaccident.â€ Another BJP legislator from the state, Sangeet Som, already facing charges for allegedly inciting communal riots, visited Dadri following Akhlaqâ€™s killing to show solidarity with the accused, one of whom is the son of a local BJP leader. Som did not condemn Akhlaqâ€™s murder and instead criticized the state government for not taking legal action against Akhlaqâ€™s family. In Haryana, the neighboring state, the chief minister, from BJP, called Akhlaqâ€™s killing a â€œsimple misunderstandingâ€ and said, â€œMuslims can continue to live in this country, but they will have to give up eating beef.â€",

The fears have especially elevated after an incident of religious discrimination earlier this year in which the LRO accused the Christian missionaries of using children to foment protest and not allowing a priest belonging to a local faith to be cremated at the traditional ceremony. This case had gone to the High Court which ruled in favour of LRO. Thus the issue is essentially the conflict between missionaries and Hindu Organisation and their respective treatment of the indigenous population.",
